Lore ideas:

Player character (you) are looking for your little sister. You saw her run into this dungeon.

You catch glimpses of her or hear her voice every now and then, but no matter how hard you try, you can never quite catch up to her.

Eldritch bosses, after defeating them, you hear many voices speaking as one voice asking you to choose: life or strength (the stat ups dropped by the bosses)

(optional) perhaps there are three different endings depending on if you choose pure life, pure strength, or a mixture

(optional) merchant character reveals a lot of lore to you and hints at the truth behind your situation, hints which get less subtle the farther you go

the truth is, you're already dead. You died the instant you stepped into the dungeon. Your sister is dead too.

there's an inscription on the outside that, if you had stopped to read, would have told you "all who step foot within forfeit their life in exchange for the possibility of limitless power/of becoming a god."

(optional) three endings come into play here. Choosing a mixture of life and strength (power) traps you there forever? (forever chasing after your sister and climbing higher levels). Choosing pure power/strength turns you into one of the eldritch gods you face, the "bosses." Choosing pure life allows you to go back to the land of the living (with your sister? Or do you have to choose between saving yourself or your sister?)

If only one ending, can just choose one of the above ideas.
